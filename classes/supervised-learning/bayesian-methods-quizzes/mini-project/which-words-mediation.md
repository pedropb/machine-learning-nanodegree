## What set of words in a memo do you think could help predict what a missing word might be? 

Based on my intuition on how humans interpret text, I would say that the set of words that can help predict what a missing word might be are nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives, because they are central to understanding the context of the sentence. For academic purposes, I would do research investigating statistically the words that have the better split on the following words. This would be empirically the best words to predict a missing word. Also note, that these conclusions may change regarding the language used during the study.

## What are some advantages and disadvantages of using more or fewer possible influences in prediction? 

The advantages of using more influences on prediction is the ability to generalize better. For instance, if the model can be built upon a vast vocabulary with lots of data to sample on, it might infer some relationships between words that a simpler model might not be able to infer. The disadvantage is that if the model doesn't have enough data, it might overfit and be too sensitive to noise, thus casting wrong predictions.
